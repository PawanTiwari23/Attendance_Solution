A desktop application built in Java Swing that automates attendance management using QR codes. Each user receives a unique QR code, which can later be scanned to mark attendance. Integrated with MySQL for backend storage and QRGen/ZXing libraries for generating and reading codes. This solution enhances accuracy, prevents duplicate check-ins, and reduces manual overhead.
